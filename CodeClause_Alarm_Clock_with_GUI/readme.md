# Alarm Clock using Tkinter
This project implements a simple alarm clock application using the Tkinter library in Python. The user can set the time for the alarm, and the alarm will sound at the specified time.

## Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Tkinter library
## Features
* Set alarm time
* Display current time
* Alarm sounds at specified time
## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the code is stored.
3. Run the following command in your terminal:
Copy code
```python
python alarm_clock.py
```
4. Enter the desired alarm time in the format HH:MM and click the Set Alarm button.
5. The current time will be displayed on the GUI, and the alarm will sound at the specified time.
## Customizing the Alarm Sound
You can change the alarm sound by replacing the sound.wav file in the repository with a different audio file. The file should be in .wav format.

## Conclusion
This project provides a basic implementation of an alarm clock using Tkinter in Python. Feel free to modify and extend the code to add new features and improve the overall user experience.
