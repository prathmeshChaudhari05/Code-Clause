# Python Projects
This repository contains three Python projects:

## [URL Shortener](https://github.com/prathmeshChaudhari05/Code-Clause/tree/main/CodeClause_URL_Shorten)
A simple Python script that can shorten a given URL using a URL shortening service. The script takes in a long URL and returns a shortened URL. For this I have used Bitly API.

A graphical user interface (GUI) alarm clock application built using Python and the tkinter library. The user can set an alarm time, Alarm Sound(some build-in sounds can be used)

## [Voice Assistant](https://github.com/prathmeshChaudhari05/Code-Clause/tree/main/CodeClause_Voice_Assistant_Using_Python)
